        <h1>Red right hand</h1>
        <h2><a href="#">Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds</a>
        </h2>

        <p> Take a little walk to the edge of town
            And go across the tracks
            Where the viaduct looms
            Like a bird of doom
            As it shifts and cracks
            Where secrets lie in the border fires
            In the humming wires
            Hey man, you know
            You're never coming back</p>

        <p>Past the square, past the bridge
            Past the mills, past the stacks
            On a gathering storm comes
            A tall handsome man
            In a dusty black coat with
            A red right hand</p>

        <p>He'll wrap you in his arms,
            Tell you that you've been a good boy
            He'll rekindle all the dreams
            It took you a lifetime to destroy
            He'll reach deep into the hole
            Heal your shrinking soul
            But there won't be a single thing that you can do</p>

        <p>You don't have no money?
            He'll get you some
            You don't have no car?
            He'll get you one
            You don't have no self-respect
            You feel like an insect
            Well don't you worry buddy
            'Cause here he comes
            Through the ghettos and the barrio
            And the Bowery and the slum
            A shadow is cast wherever he stands
            Stacks of green paper in his
            Red right hand</p>

        <p>You'll see him in your nightmares
            You'll see him in your dreams
            He'll appear out of nowhere but
            He ain't what he seems
            You'll see him in your head
            On the TV screen
            Hey buddy, I'm warning
            You to turn it off
            He's a ghost, he's a god
            He's a man, he's a guru
            You're one microscopic cog
            In his catastrophic plan
            Designed and directed by
            His red right hand</p>
